            <p><span>Together in Tradition </span> is a festival celebration event promoting 
                traditional Chinese culture held at the Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month. 
                This event lasts for three days and is held on the elementary school campus, 
                mainly targeting the families of students in the school and people in the nearby
                community. The event aims to make Chinese American children proud of Chinese 
                culture and to provide other ethnic families in the school and nearby neighborhood
                with a better understanding of Chinese culture.</p>
